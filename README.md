# WebFetch
Get info from webpages.

# What you need (Requirements)
you'll possibly need : requests. However, the newest versions of python might ship with this
automatically. If you don't have requests just run "pip install requests".

# Which file does what?
webFetch.py is the only file for this project. The rest are examples (really I'm just using github
as cloud storage).
